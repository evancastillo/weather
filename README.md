* This Challenge is the creation of a weather app that allows you to search a city, and will return the temperature, the wind, the humidity, and the UV index.

1. The data will be brought in through the openweather api.
2. The forecast that is displayed will be for 5 days.

* After you search for a city, the city will be saved in localstorage so you can click on the city in the list and be brought back to that forecast.

1. You can click on the city to pull the results again.
2. Refreshing the page will not clear the results.
3. You can clear the search history using the "clear history" button.
